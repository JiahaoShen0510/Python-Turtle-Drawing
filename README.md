Apply the Python Turtle to create four drawing projects.

01) Continuous Polygon: Draw the 10 layers of polygons that the next one fully builts on and covers the previous one. Each polygon is generated with randomized colors. 

02) Spirograph: Draw the 72 layers of spirographs that are seamlessly circled together, and are generated with randomized colors. 

03) Random Walk: Let the turtle walks in random directions in 1,000 steps, and each step is drawed with randomized colors. 

04) Art of Dot: Inspired by the work of Hirst painting, create the 10X10 dot square, which each dot is generated with randomized color.
